A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period (e.g., are born, leave school, lose their job, are exposed to a drug or a vaccine, etc.). The comparison group may be the general population from which the cohort is drawn, or it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no exposure to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar. Alternatively, subgroups within the cohort may be compared with each other.</summary>

Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic, endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic, iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric, oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic, toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well.</summary>

        <member name="T:Bam.Net.Schema.Org.Series">
            <summary>          A Series in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind.          Series are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike ItemList which          is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with Series          is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as          tv, radio and games).                    Specific subtypes are available for describing TVSeries, RadioSeries,          MovieSeries,          BookSeries,          Periodical          and VideoGameSeries. In each case,          the hasPart / isPartOf properties          can be used to relate the Series to its parts. The general Series type serves largely          just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.                    It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group.          Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply          properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.</summary>

            <summary>Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).</summary>
