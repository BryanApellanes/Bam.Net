DaoRepository behavior notes:

Automatic wiring of one-to-one relationships is not supported, either create an 
implicit one-to-many and enforce it as one-to-one in code or manually wire the 
relationship in code

Query will not fully hydrate child lists, to fully hydrate call Retrieve(id) or 
Retrieve(uuid)

Setting foreign key Id will hydrate related property on Retrieve

If a class defines a parent class (ParentId and Parent property pairs) and the parent 
doesn't define a child array no association will be implicitly made

If a class defines a parent class (ParentId and Parent property pairs) and the childs 
property representing the parent is not declared "virtual" no association will be 
implicitly made

If a class defines a child list and the child list is not declared "virtual" no association
will be implicitly made
