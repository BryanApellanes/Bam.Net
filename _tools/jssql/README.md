# JsSql - JavaScript SQL 

A straight through server allowing SQL scripts to be passed from
JavaScript to a SQL server returning JSON responses.  This is not
secured by encryption or an api key so it should only be used
on a secure network and should not be exposed on a public network.  
For a secure connection over public networks consider generated Qi 
controllers, see ***Data Access Object (Dao) Generation*** with 
[LaoTze](../LaoTze/) or with [LaoTzu](../LaoTzu/).  See also 
[Troo](../Tvg/Troo).
