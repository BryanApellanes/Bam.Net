# Bake

Bake.exe is a tool used to build the BamToolkit and Bam.Net nuget packages.

## TL;DR
To cut a release, execute the following commands:

```
cd C:\bam\src\Bam.Net
git checkout next 
git pull
cd C:\bam\tools\bake
bake /release:C:\bam\src\Bam.Net [/releaseNotesSince:[major].[minor].[patch]]
bake /publish:public
```

To run a build, deploy, test cycle execute the following commands:

```
cd C:\bam\tools\bake
bake /build:.\build.json
bake /deploy:.\deploy-test.json
bake /test:.\unit-tests.json
```

Ensure when running the test step above, you use an administrator command prompt and the executable is on a local drive.

## Build

Example
```
bake /build:[path_to_build_json_file]
```

When build mode is selected, a build is run using the specified build config.  The build config is
a json serialized BuildConfig object.  The BuildConfig definition has the same properties
defined as the bambot configs.  Bambot configs will properly deserialize as BuildConfig instances.

You may also override the branch defined in the config file by specifying the /branch:**branch_name** switch.

For more information, see [Understanding BuildConfig Properties (build.json)](docs/buld-dot-json.md)

## Deploy

Example:
```
bake /deploy:[path_to_deploy_json_file]
```

When deploy mode is selected, the Bam based Windows services and Daemon executables defined in the 
specified deploy config are deployed.  The json in the specified deploy config should deserialize
to a DeployInfo instance.

Each Windows service defined in the deploy config is an executable where the main entry point
is defined in a class that extends ServiceExe.  Command line switches defined in ServiceExe.ProcessCommandLineArgs
are used to stop, uninstall, install and start the Windows service defined in the executable.  If
credentials are found using the local credential manager (Bam.Net.Encryption.CredentialManager.Local) the
service is set to use the credentials found.

Each Daemon defined in the deploy config is a long running process but is not necessarily a Windows service.
Daemons are executed and monitored by the Bam Daemon, see [bamd](../bamd/).  If
credentials are found for "bamd" using the local credential manager (Bam.Net.Encryption.CredentialManager.Local) the
service is set to use the credentials found.

## Test

Example:
```
bake /test:[path_to_test_config_json_file]
```

When test mode is selected, bake will invoke [bamtestrunner](../bamtestrunner) with the /TestsWithCoverage switch
reporting results to the server specified in the test config file.

You may also override the tag defined in the config file by specifying the /tag:**tag_value** switch.  In either case the
tag used has the first 6 characters of the commit appended.

## Init

Example:
```
bake /init
```

When init mode is selected, the repositoryPath and globalPackagesFolder nuget config settings
are set by making calls to nuget.exe.  The values used are from the app.config file (RepositoryPath and
GlobalPackagesFolder), or, if the values are not present in app.config a prompt is shown.

## Nuget

Example:
```
bake /nuget:init | [target_path]
```

When nuget:init mode is selected, nuspec files are created or updated for the projects found in 
all the solutions in the source root.

You may also specify the command line argument **/releaseNotesSince:[major].[minor].[patch]** to specify what version to go back to
when compiling commit messages for nuget release notes.

When nuget:[target_path] mode is selected and [target_path] references a file, then that file is packed
as a nuget package.  If [target_path] references a directory, all nuspec files in the directory
are packed as nuget packages.

## Clean

Example:
```
bake /clean
```

When clean mode is selected, the local nuget caches are cleared and any "-Dev-latest" packages
are deleted.

## Latest

Example:
```
bake /latest
```

When latest mode is selected, the binaries are expected to exist in the path 
{Builds}{Platform}{FrameworkVersion}\Debug\_**{latest}**, where **{latest}** is
the commit hash read from {Builds}\latest and each remaining variable
value is specified in the config file.  The resulting nuget packages have 
the suffix "-Dev-latest".

All binaries are also copied to C:\bam\latest so any projects referencing the binaries
are automatically updated to reference the latest binaries when they are rebuilt.

## Commit
Example:
```
bake /commit:0b815
```

When commit mode is selected, **argument** is the commit hash of the build to pack.  The argument specified is
the first X number of characters of the commit hash used to uniquely identify a specific commit.  The binaries
are expected to exist in the path {Builds}{Platform}{FrameworkVersion}\Debug\_**{argument}**, where each variable
value is specified in the config file.  The resulting nuget packages have the suffix 
"-Dev-**first five characters of commit hash**".

## Dev
Example:
```
bake /dev:C:\bam\BuildOutput
```

When dev mode is selected, **argument** is the path to where the Bam.Net binaries are found.  The 
version number used is the latest release version with the commit hash appended in the format -Dev.{commitHash}.  

## Release 
Example
```
bake /release:C:\bam\src\Bam.Net
```

When release mode is selected, **argument** is the path to the root directory where the Bam.Net source
files are found.  If no version is specified, the patch level is incremented and the resulting version is used.

The bake tool will initiate a release build before creating the nuget packages.
As part of the release build the version is set in all AssemblyInfo.cs files. If no version is specified 
the patch number is incremented and the result is used as the version.  You may specify any combination 
of the command line switches, /major, /minor or /patch to increment the associated version part.  Additionally, 
an msi is created as part of the release by prompting for the location of wix merge module and project files.

You may also specify the command line argument **/releaseNotesSince:[major].[minor].[patch]** to specify what version to go back to
when compiling commit messages for nuget release notes.

## Publish
Example
```
bake /publish:internal
```
or
```
bake /publish:public
```

When publish mode is slected, **argument** is the kind of nuget source to publish to.  If _internal_ is specified
the nuget packages are added to the nuget repository specified by NugetInternalSource in the app.config file.  If _public_
is specified the nuget packages are pushed to the nuget repository specified by NugetPublicSource in the app.config file.
Additionally, if _public_ is selcted the version update is committed and tagged.
